# Loyalty and Rewards Program using Fungible Tokens
This is Backend Code of [FlipCoin-Frontend](https://github.com/pratapavinesh/FlipCoin-Frontend)

Welcome to the Loyalty and Rewards Program project! This project aims to develop a blockchain-enabled loyalty and rewards program for E-commerce platforms. The project leverages blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and user engagement in the rewards and loyalty ecosystem.

## Features

- Generate fungible tokens as loyalty points on the blockchain.
- Define tokenomics, including token value and issuance rules.
- Implement effective account settlement/reconciliation between Brands and E-commerce platforms.
- Earn loyalty points through user actions such as purchases, referrals, and social media interactions.
- Distribute earned tokens securely and transparently to customers' digital wallets.
- Partners and sellers can issue tokens to loyal customers.
- Redeem rewards using tokens with transparent, on-chain tracking.
- All token transactions are recorded on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pratapavinesh/FlipCoin-Backend.git`

3. Install client dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start a local Hardhat Ethereum node: `npx hardhat node`
5. Deploy contracts to the local node: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
